## Configuration

| Parameter | Description |
|-----|----|
| `translation_kp` | The proportional gain for the translation PID controller. Controls how strongly the robot reacts to translation errors. |
| `translation_ki` | The integral gain for the translation PID controller. Helps eliminate steady-state errors over time. |
| `translation_kd` | The derivative gain for the translation PID controller. Damps oscillations by reacting to the rate of change of translation errors. |
| `enable_rotation` | Whether to enable the rotation PID controller. If disabled, the robot will not rotate to face the path's direction. `twist.angular.z` always remains zero. |
| `rotation_kp` | The proportional gain for the rotation PID controller. Controls how strongly the robot reacts to rotational errors. |
| `rotation_ki` | The integral gain for the rotation PID controller. Helps eliminate steady-state rotational errors. |
| `rotation_kd` | The derivative gain for the rotation PID controller. Damps oscillations by reacting to the rate of change of rotational errors. |
| `transform_tolerance` | The tolerance for transforming between frames. A higher value may allow for more flexibility in handling small delays in the transformation. |
| `min_max_sum_error` | The minimum threshold for the maximum sum of errors used to limit the accumulated error in the PID controller to prevent windup. |
| `lookahead_dist` | The fixed lookahead distance used to find the lookahead point for path following. |
| `use_velocity_scaled_lookahead_dist` | Whether to scale the lookahead distance based on the current velocity, instead of using a constant distance. |
| `min_lookahead_dist` | The minimum allowable lookahead distance when using velocity scaling for the lookahead point. |
| `max_lookahead_dist` | The maximum allowable lookahead distance when using velocity scaling for the lookahead point. |
| `lookahead_time` | The time used to project the robot's velocity to calculate the velocity-scaled lookahead distance. |
| `use_interpolation` | Enables interpolation between poses along the path when selecting the lookahead point, improving smoothness but potentially increasing computational cost. |
| `use_rotate_to_heading` | Whether to rotate the robot to face the path's direction before moving forward, useful in holonomic robots. |
| `use_rotate_to_heading_treshold` | The angular threshold at which the robot should rotate in place to align with the desired heading. |
| `min_approach_linear_velocity` | The minimum linear velocity when approaching the goal to ensure the robot moves slowly when close to its target. |
| `approach_velocity_scaling_dist` | The distance from the goal where velocity scaling starts when approaching, slowing the robot down as it nears the target. |
| `v_linear_min` | The minimum translation speed the robot can command, allowing for reverse or slow-forward movement. |
| `v_linear_max` | The maximum translation speed the robot can command, setting the upper limit for forward movement. |
| `v_angular_min` | The minimum rotation speed the robot can command, allowing for counter-clockwise rotation. |
| `v_angular_max` | The maximum rotation speed the robot can command, setting the upper limit for clockwise rotation. |
| `curvature_min` | The minimum curvature threshold below which no speed reduction is applied. |
| `curvature_max` | The maximum curvature threshold above which significant speed reduction is applied. |
| `reduction_ratio_at_high_curvature` | The speed reduction ratio at high curvature. 0.5 means a 50% reduction. |
| `curvature_forward_dist` | The forward distance used for curvature calculation. |
| `curvature_backward_dist` | The backward distance used for curvature calculation. |
| `max_velocity_scaling_factor_rate` | The maximum rate of change for the velocity scaling factor. |
| `max_robot_pose_search_dist` | The maximum distance along the path to search for the robot's closest pose, used to keep the robot on the planned path. |
